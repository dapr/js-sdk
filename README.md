## Getting Started

Instantly get started by installing the Dapr JS SDK and reading the [getting started documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/js/) or [follow one of the quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts)

```
npm install --save @dapr/dapr
```

You can also use the development version of the SDK which is built from the `main` branch. Make sure to remove the `@dapr/dapr` package first. This package is not meant for production use, and should only be used for development purposes.

```
npm install --save @dapr/dapr-dev
```
