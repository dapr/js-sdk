# Actor Parking Sensor

This example shows a car parking area where cars (virtual actors) enter and leave randomly. The car sensor data is sent via Dapr actors to InfluxDB and displayed on Grafana.

## Prerequisites

Start influxdb, telegraf and grafana using docker-compose.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Running

```bash
# Build the Source (from the root)
./build.sh

# Install (from the example directory)
npm install

# Build and run the example
npm run build
npm run start:dapr
```

## Visualize

Start Grafana on [localhost:3001](localhost:3001) and use the credentials `admin`:`password` to login and visualize the dashboard!

Sample output:
