# Reference

Below a reference can be found of how you can get started with this SDK, utilizing the different features offered by [Dapr](https://dapr.io).

## Service Invocation

The service invocation methods are created as a warpper on the [Dapr Service Invocation API](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/api/service_invocation_api/).

### Invoking a method

```typescript
await client.invoker.invoke("app-id", "method", { hello: "world" });
```

### Listening to a method call

On top of the invoking, this SDK also implements a trivial way to listen to app invocations. Instead of creating your own web server, you can simply run the following commands which will listen to calls coming in on the provided endpoint.

```typescript
const invokerListen = (req: IRequest, res: IResponse) => {
  console.log(data);
};
await client.invoker.listen("method", invokerListen.bind(this), options);
```
